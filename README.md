SuperController is an [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) application boostrapped with [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate). Designed with music preformance in mind, SuperController can be used to interact with MIDI clients in ways new and creative ways. Simply plug in devices, add the device to the current project, and take greater control over your devices than ever before.

Basic usage guides can be found at the [SuperController knowledgebase](https://help.supercontroller.net/books/setup).
