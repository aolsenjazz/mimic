Mimic is an [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) application boostrapped with [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate). It is designed with the purpose of simplying software testing for MIDI-centric applications, though it can fit plenty of use cases outside of this.

## Device Support

Mimic repurposes the driver files created by and for [SuperController](https://www.github.com/aolsenjazz/super-controller). If a device is supported, it will have a driver file there. Supporting more devices makes this software more useful for everyone so if you are able to write drivers for your devices, please do so! If not, please [open a pull request](https://github.com/aolsenjazz/mimic/pulls) and we'll work together to get your device supported.
